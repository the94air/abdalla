                            <p class="about-text">I am a senior developer. I wrote my first line of code 5 years ago when I was at college. Currently, I build Single Page Applications, PHP Websites, and Admin panels with the help of Laravel Framework and CSS/JavaScript bundlers like Webpack. My favorite JavaScript Framework is Vue. I love the Internet and anything opensource.</p>
