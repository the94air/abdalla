                            <p class="about-text">I am a senior developer. Five years ago, I wrote my first line of code. In my career, I focus on designing, coding, and deploying web applications. Most of the time, I build PHP Websites and admin panels with Laravel Framework with the help of CSS and JavaScript preprocessors like Webpack. My favorite JavaScript Framework is Vue. I am used to working with APIs whenever it needed because it makes our life more easier and more connected.</p>
